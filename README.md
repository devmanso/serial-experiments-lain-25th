# How to open the website on your computer:
- Download this repo
- navigate to testing folder 
- open index.html in your browser (double click on it)


# Things that don't work
- The timer that displays time remaining until destruction
- Perhaps setting the system time to before April 1st could fix this issue, but I've yet to try
- The email form on the bottom of the page (although it never seemed to work properly anyway)

# What about the HTML files in the root directory of this repo?
- index.html and index_TIMER_NOFONT.html only save the message on the website, nothing else.
